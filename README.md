# nlp-user-classification
This code is part of the final grade project titled "User categorization using text analysis NLP methods". It is focused on classifying texts based on sentiment analysis by means of machine learning techniques and NLP methods.

The project was developed during the summer semester of 2021 in the Technical University of Cartagena, directed by Javier Vales Alonso.

The code is available in Jupyter Notebooks, and results of the simulations can be found in the figures folder. Due to a matter of size, models nor data are available in the repository. Models can be built by executing the notebooks, and data can be found entering the following links:
