# nlp-user-classification
This code is part of the Telematics Engineering final grade project titled "User categorization using text analysis NLP methods". It is focused on classifying texts based on sentiment analysis by means of machine learning techniques and NLP methods. In particular, Keras is used to explore different solutions based in Artificial Neural Networks. Metrics will be gathered to determined which has the best behaviour.

The project was developed during the summer semester of 2021, in the Technical University of Cartagena, directed by Javier Vales Alonso.

The code is available in Jupyter Notebooks, and results of the simulations can be found in the figures folder. Due to a matter of size, models and data are not available in the repository. Models can be built by executing the notebooks, and data can be found entering the following links:

- Training data: "Stanford/Google Drive link", http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students
- GloVe embeddings: "glove.6B.zip", https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

The notebooks were executed using an Anaconda environment, based on Python 3.6 and Tensorflow 1.15, due to compatibility reasons. The full environment can be found in the environment.yml file.
